One Standard Error Matlab
One Standard Error Rule: The One Standard Error Rule can be used to compare models with different numbers of 
parameters in order to select the most parsimonious model with low error. To use, find a model with minimum error, 
then select the simplest model whose mean falls within 1 standard deviation of the minimum
as the following describes the Matlab file :
1-  rankOSE.m calculate the Standard Error Rule
2- The deleterankOSE.m  calculate Standard Error Rule and  delete one of your elements as the inputbox question and you can determine what you want to delete 
3-  ranknum fun  is to calculate the rank of your data and choose what type of rank you want using as following :
 P  | Ranking Type    | Ties get ... rank | V = [1 2 2 4] -> R =
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1  | Dense (default) | same              |   1  2   2  3
 2  | Ordinal         | consecutive       |   1  2   3  4
 3  | Competition     | same minimum      |   1  2   2  4
 4  | Modified Comp.  | same maximum      |   1  3   3  4
  5  | Fractional      | same average      |   1 2.5 2.5 4
